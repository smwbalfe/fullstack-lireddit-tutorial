me -> browse http://localhost:3000
   -> next.js server
   -> request graphql server at localhost:4000 > fetch posts
   -> builds HTML
   -> sends back to the browser 
  
ssr does not occur if we press back after refresh from re routing as its making the request
again from the browser instead.
